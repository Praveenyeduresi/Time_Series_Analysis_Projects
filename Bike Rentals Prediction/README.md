## Project Title : Bike Rentals Prediction

**Objective:** This project aims to predict future bike rentals using machine learning models.

**Data Loading:** The dataset is loaded from day.csv and hour.csv using Pandas.

**Data Preprocessing:** 
- Checked for missing values and handled inconsistencies.
- Converted categorical variables to numerical representations.
- Performed feature engineering where necessary.
  
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.
- Analyzed trends, seasonality, and correlations.
- Performed time series decomposition.

**Model Training and Evaluation:** 
- Implemented machine learning models such as: Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor.
- Evaluated models using RMSE and RÂ² scores.

**Conclusion:**
Identified key factors influencing bike rentals.
Selected the best-performing model for predictions.
